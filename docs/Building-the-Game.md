## Windows
1. Download [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe).
2. Wait for the Visual Studio Installer to install.
3. On the Visual Studio installation screen, go to "Individual Components" and select the following:
    * MSVC v143 VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools
    * Windows 10/11 SDK
        * You can skip this by running `msvc.bat`.
4. Once the details are correct, press "Install".
    * ⚠ This will require 4-5GB of available space on your computer.
5. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).
6. Install the dependencies by running `setup.bat`.
7. Open a Command Prompt/Powershell window in the `Rhythmo-SC` folder, and run `haxelib run lime test windows` to build and launch the game.
    * You can run `haxelib run lime setup` to make the lime command global, allowing you to execute `lime test windows` directly.
